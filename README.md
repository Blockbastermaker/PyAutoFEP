# PyAutoFEP
**PyAutoFEP: an automated FEP workflow for GROMACS integrating enhanced sampling methods**

PyAutoFEP is a tool to automate Free Energy Perturbations (FEP) calculations to estimate Relative Free Energies of Binding (RFEB) of small molecules to 
macromolecular targets. It automates the generation of perturbation maps, the building of dual-topologies for ligand pairs, the setup of MD systems, and 
the analysis. Distinctivelly, PyAutoFEP supports multiple force fields, integrates enhanced sampling methods, and allows flexible λ windows schemes. 
Furthermore, it aims to be as flexible as possible, giving the user great control over all steps. Nevertheless, reasonable defaults and automation are 
provided, so that PyAutoFEP can be used by non experts. PyAutoFEP is written in Python3 and uses GROMACS.

## Announcements
**Commit c6e427c (06.11.2022)**<br/>
This commit fixes the restraint code. Restraints can be selected by passing `mdp_substitution` to `prepare_dual_topology.py`, eg:
```ini
mdp_substitution = define: -DPOSRES_PROTEIN_CA
```
The following restraints are automatically generated and can bu used in this manner.

| Molecule | `make_ndx` selection restraint | Affected atoms        | Define            |
|----------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Ligand   | LIG                            | All atoms             | POSRES_LIG        |
| Protein  | Protein-H                      | Protein's heavy atoms | POSRES_PROTEIN    |
| Protein  | C-alpha                        | Protein's C&alpha;    | POSRES_PROTEIN_CA |
| Protein  | Backbone                       | Protein's backbond    | POSRES_PROTEIN_BB |
| Water    | Water                          | Water molecules       | POSRES_WATER      |

**Commit f8324a3 (22.09.2022)**<br/>
This commit contains a massive backport of upcoming charge-changing perturbations to the topology reading code. This new code broadens the topology support, allowing for the following.
- **Topologies containing A and B states**. Note, however, that B states will not be used to prepare the dual topology! Dual topology is built from distinct molecules. In case the input topology has both A and B states, `prepare_dual_topology.py` will merely check that states A and B match (eg, as generated by SwissParam), and use data from state A.
- **New code for concomitant perturbing charge and VdW parameter of atoms**. Not really used yet, but paves way for charge-changing perturbations and perturbing atoms in rings.
- **General topology coverage**. Online dihedrals and more terms are supported.

**Commit 190bef6 (06.06.2022)**<br/>
This commit brings three new major features: 
- **OpenBabel 3.X is now supported**, along with backward compatibility with OpenBabel 2.4. Because OpenBabel 3 series is the one actively maintained upstream, all users are recommended to upgrade.
- **Reading of poses from Vina (and derivatives) .pdbqt files.** `prepare_dual_topology.py` now accepts `pose_loader=vina` which reads .pdbqt files. Poses in a ligand file can be selected setting `poses_advanced_options` `cluster_docking_data` (see manual for more info).
- **Automated parameterization of input ligands.** `prepare_dual_topology.py` can now run external small molecule parameterization tools automatically (using `parameterize` and related options, see manual for further info). Currently, the only parameterization software supported is [AcPYPE](https://github.com/alanwilter/acpype), but I hope others can be added soon. 
 
Furthermore, this update fixes some bugs and improves 3D MCS code, which is now more robust. Two defaults changed: in `prepare_dual_topology.py`, `gmx_bin_run=gmx_mpi` is now the default, as a MPI-enabled `gmx` executable is required and GROMACS compiles a `gmx_mpi` when using MPI. Also, `generate_perturbation_map.py` now will not save full_graph.svg and result_plot.svg unless the verbosity is at least INFO. 

As always, please, fill issues should you experience any problems.

**Commit fe41f7d (19.01.2022)**<br/>
This commit introduces a bunch of new features and code changes. Even though I tested newly implemented and rewritten code, **things may break**. Please, fill 
issues should you experience any problem. Main changes:
- Modifications to the atom matching functions in PyAutoFEP were done to implement support for user-supplied atom maps.
- User-supplied atom maps are also available for the superimpose pose loader
- Selecting 3D MCS for merge_topologies.merge_topologies is now supported (3D MCS in generate_perturbation_map.py and superimpose loader coming soon)
- 3D MCS code rewritten for better support for ligand pairs with multiple atom matches

## Requirements
- Common GNU programs: Bash, awk, tar
- [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/) 2016 or newer
- [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) on the run node, used during the rerun step (See manual for details).
- Python 3.6+
- [rdkit](https://www.rdkit.org/) 2019.03+
- [networkx](https://networkx.org) 2.X (1.X versions are not supported)

Optional requirements. The following are not required to run basic calculations in PyAutoFEP, but are needed for specific functions.

- [biopython](https://biopython.org/) (allows sequence alignment when reading initial pose data)

## Roadmap
Aside from bug squashing, I am currently working on charged perturbations and in a GUI.

- Charged pertubations are being implemented using the alchemical co-ion method, which seems to be both most general and simpler to code. Briefly, and random water molecule will be perturbed to an ion of the opposite charge as the ligand perturbation. At first, only charge differences of +1 and -1 will be supported (this should cover most of the use cases, anyway). Code for regular, non-charged perturbations will not be affected.
- A PyQt5 GUI for PyAutoFEP is being written. So far, a perturbation map editor was mostly implemented and a ligand table is beign worked on. The GUI will be frontend to the scripts, so that no function will depend on using the first. The GUI development is low priority right now, so this is not making into the tree anytime soon.

Further goals
- Covalent perturbations
- Automated cycle-closure histeresis (and likely other analysis as well)
- Support for peptides as ligands
- More tutorials
- A website
